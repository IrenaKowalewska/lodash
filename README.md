This repository is an attempt by our team to implement a collection of tasks for pulling up their skills in pure js.

## Set up

You can [download](https://github.com/webpct/lodash/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the project for Windows, macOS and Linux or use bash terminal for this.

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/webpct/lodash.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## How To Use

To clone and install dependenses, you can try to see the main idea of the project. From your command line:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

You'll need to create a new [branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) and to call it by your name.

```bash
$ git checkout -b "Name_Surname"
```

The next step to open one of the the many challenges and try to write a function implementation.

Finally you need to create a new [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) when you finish your task.

### Commit standart:
[fileName] - description
One function one commit.

### Example:
[parseInt] - implement function

```bash
# Index all files
$ git add [FILE].js

# Create a commit
$ git commit -m "[name of file] - comment"

# Push your changes in your branch
$ git push origin [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME]
```

Please be sure that your code passes tests before sending it

## Library

* You can use the documentation of [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/) to learn the implementation details of some functions.
